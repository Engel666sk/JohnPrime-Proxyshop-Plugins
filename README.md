# John Prime-Proxyshop-Plugins
A custom templates for [Proxyshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_uG3so5GxyM3CVpFHuZSYsOZOdF6n5W?usp=share_link) similar to the standard Borderless frame, except it's for MDFC's and Transform Cards. The textbox is also modular, and will expand and shrink based on the length of oracle text.
